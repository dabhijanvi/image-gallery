# ✨ Simple HTML Image Gallery Project ✨
This project features a basic image gallery layout built entirely using HTML (and optionally styled with CSS). It's a static, non-functional gallery that visually showcases a set of images — ideal for beginners learning how to structure visual content on a webpage.


## 🌟 Project Overview
🖼️ Image Grid Layout:<br>
Displays a collection of images arranged in a grid-style layout using rows and columns.<br>

🧱 Static Thumbnails:<br>
Each image is placed within a container without any interactive or dynamic behavior.<br>

🖥️ Inline Arrangement:<br>
Images are stacked or aligned depending on screen size and styling.<br>

🚫 No JavaScript:<br>
This version does not include click-to-enlarge or lightbox features — purely structural.<br>


## 🎨 Technology Used
✅ HTML5 – Used to build the structure of the gallery:<br>

– section or div for the main gallery container<br>
– img tags for inserting images<br>

(Optional) ✅ CSS – Can be added to style the gallery with:
<br>
– Grid or Flexbox for layout control<br>
– Borders, spacing, and hover effects<br>
– Image sizing and alignment<br>


## 🚀 Key Design Elements
✔️ Simple Layout:<br>
Images placed in rows or a grid to form a clean gallery structure.<br>

✔️ Beginner-Friendly:<br>
Great for understanding how to place and group visual elements in HTML.<br>

✔️ Customizable:<br>
Easily enhanced later with hover animations, lightbox features, or JavaScript interactions.<br>

✔️ Mobile Preview:<br>
Not responsive by default, but easy to modify for smaller screens using media queries.<br>
